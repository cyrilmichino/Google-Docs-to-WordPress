### This Python Script automates the process of adding posts into WordPress from Google Docs.
Most people today use Google Docs for document editing including bloggers and site owners. Unfortunately, the process of adding a Google Doc into WordPress is still cumbersome and involves alot of copy and paste tasks as well as additional editing to fulfil the ultimate goal of getting your draft post published. In this script we automate this entire process so that all that publishers need to do is to:

1. Create, download and validate their Google Docs API credentials (Only done once)
2. Post the link to the target Google Doc into a Python Input Function (Link posted should allow anyone to view)
3. Input the link to their WordPress website as well as their personal access credentials (username and password)

This script ***also supports custome post types*** and ***maintains the document format*** such that no additional work is required out of whatever was already done on Google Docs. 

**Now you can work and collaborate on all your posts on Google Drive using a UI/tool that almost everyone is familiar with and not worry about additional processes to get your post published.**

### Missing Features/Coming Soon
* Bulk Post Posting from a Google Drive Folder
* Post Edits from Google Docs to Existing WordPress Posts

## Instructions
**Usage instructions are coming soon**, for the time being you can use the Python Quickstart instructions by Google if you are stuck on how to build your Google Docs API credentials and allow this script to gain access to your target Google Doc/Folder.
